/**
 KDIEmptyView is a UIView subclass for use as the placeholder view when there is no data available. For example, if the containing view displays items that the user has favorited, an instance of this calss could be used to display a call to action prompting the user to favorite an item. Another example would be if the user's permission is required before content can be displayed (e.g. Photos permission).
 
 The relevant subviews are stacked vertically and centered horizontally:
 
 [image (UIImageView)]
    |
 [headline (UILabel)]
    |
 [loading (UIActivityIndicatorView)]-[body (UILabel)]
    |
 [action (UIButton)]
 
 The *image* and *action* will be tinted accordingly based on the receiver's tintColor property. The *body* and *action* are the same font size. The *headline* font is slightly larger and bold. The fonts used are based on dynamic type.
