/**
 KDIButton is a subclass of UIButton that provides custom style and alignment options. Notably, you can set the alignment for title and image independantly of one another. This allows for unique layout combinations. For example, you can tell the button to layout the image at the top, title at the bottom, and center them both horizontally. 
 
 It also conforms to KDIBorderedView, allowing it to display borders.
