/**
 KDITableViewCell is a UITableViewCell subclass that can display generic properties that can be used in a variety of situations. The layout is similar to Settings type cells, image aligned to the leading edge, title and subtitle after it stacked vertically and info aligned to the trailing edge. Internally the layout uses multiple stack views, so setting any of the value properties to nil will hide the corresponding subviews.
